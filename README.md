UPDATE:
Excited to share my shiny app exploring the geospatial varaition of anaemia prevalence in Ghanaian children under 5 years old.

Map1-Exploratory Geospatial Analysis of Urbanicity
A map showing the distribution of built environment in Ghana as 2014

Map2
Choropleth map= Geographic variation of Anaemia in Ghanaian children

I am working on a project analyzing whether urbanicity described by raster data showing built up areas is correlated with disease prevalence. The first objective was to determine if the urban/ rural designation given to geographic clusters in the 2019 Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey (GMIS) correlated with the built up environment (presence of constructed buildings) of the geographic clusters.
I overlaid vector data from the 2019 GMIS from the DHS program (www.dhsprogram.com) with raster data of built up areas from the 2014 Global Human settlement data from the European Commission Repository to create a map showing the difference.

My next objective is to investigate the relationship between urban living and the prevalence of childhood anaemia in Ghana. Thus, I combined anaemia prevalence data with vector data of the administrative boundaries of Ghana to create choropleth maps in R to display the geographic variation of the childhood anaemia prevalence in Ghana.
